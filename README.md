## About the App
It is the app intended for phones with the android system. It controls the level of volume by checking current localization with the all places added by the user
in the app. User can set the distance in meters as a range of where the phone will have set volume at the earlier specified level. When user comes out of the range,
phone will be back to previous level of volume, before entering the range of activated place.

And now, whenever the user will be in range in distance in one of this places, the phone will set the volume at the level, which user setted. Tanks to that, user won't have to remember,
to, for example, mute his phone in the library.
